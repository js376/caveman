Brain storm

On a journey, you meet a Ghost. 
He is asking for help and in order to help him,
you have to go through forest full of obstacles and monsters.
(Instead of story telling, maybe do a side scrolling obstacle game)
and each level you go up, the ghost tells you more stories about him. 

...

Like Mario game, you have secret tunnels you can enter to gain valuable objects.
