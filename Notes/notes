Brain storm

On a journey, you meet a Ghost. 
He is asking for help and in order to help him,
you have to go through forest full of obstacles and monsters.
(Instead of story telling, maybe do a side scrolling obstacle game)
and each level you go up, the ghost tells you more stories about him. 

TROLL: While finishing levels and/or quests, the Ghost pops up and asks you
a quesion about the narratives the Ghost gives you and if you get it wrong,
you start over the level. 

In order to finsh a level, you must find certain number of collectibles (for satisfaction of the players)



...

Like Mario game, you have secret tunnels you can enter to gain valuable objects. 

...

Quest idea #1
Cute dancing stage where you dance to the direction of arrows

... 

Oven break type of game without speed component?
- allows you to level up when you kill certain number of monsters
