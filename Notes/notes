Brain storm

On a journey, you meet a Ghost. 
He is asking for help and in order to help him,
you have to go through forest full of obstacles and monsters.
(Instead of story telling, maybe do a side scrolling obstacle game)
and each level you go up, the ghost tells you more stories about him. 

TROLL: While finishing levels and/or quests, the Ghost pops up and asks you
a quesion about the narratives the Ghost gives you in the beginning of the stage
and if you get it wrong, you start over the level. 

In order to finsh a level, you must find certain number of collectibles (for satisfaction of the players)



...

Like Mario game, you have secret tunnels you can enter to gain valuable objects. 

...

Quest idea #1
Cute dancing stage where you dance to the direction of arrows

... 

Oven break type of game without speed component?
- allows you to level up when you kill certain number of monsters (maybe not..)

...

Story #1
Ghost used to be a person who loves to adventure and explore.
He came across this forest with fun things to find.
There was a predecessor ghost who waited for the player. 
He tricked the Ghost into find the collectibles for him saying it's for some dire purposes.
After he completed it, the current ghost turned into a ghost while the predecessor turned back into human form.
The Ghost was tricked and now he must find his successor in order for him to go back into human form.
He tricks the people who come by the forrest to do his biddings for him whilie telling a sob? story.
